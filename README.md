# Password Generator

## Description
In this project, I had to make a password generator consisting of numbers, special characters, and lower/upper case letters. This is the first project in which I add javascript and was much harder to figure out and understand than my first two projects. After looking at other examples, I was able to make a password generator where I could understand how and why it worked.
